# Porsche-LLM
This RAG powered LLM makes use of "llama-index" modules to create two different query engines related to data about Porsche 911s. One piece of data is a flat CSV file that records mostly quantitative specs about a variety of different Porsches. Additionally, the Wikipedia page for Porsche 911 was downloaded as a PDF in full.
