1964 by Porsche AG of\nStuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine\nand originally a torsion bar suspension. The car has been\ncontinuous ly enhanced through the years but the basic\nconcept has remained unchanged.[1] The engines were air-\ncooled until the introduc tion of  the 996 s eries in 1998.[2][3]\nThe 911 has been raced extensively by private and factory\nteams, in a variety of classes. It is among the most\nsuccessful competition cars. In the mid-1970s , the naturally\naspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world championship races\nincluding Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The\n911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans\nin 1979. Porsche won the World Championship for Makes\nin 1976, 1977, 1978, a nd 1979 w ith 911-derived models.\nIn a 1999 poll to determine the Car of the Century, the 911\nwas fifth.[4] It is one of two in the top five that had\nremained continuous ly in produc tion (the original Beetle\nremained in produc tion until 2003) .[5] The one millionth\nexample was manufactured in May 2017 and is in the\ncompany's permanent collection.[6]\nAlthough Porsche has used internal code numbers for each\nseries of the 911, all models have been marketed and sold\nas 911s.

The new car made its public debut at the\n1963 Frankfurt Motor Show[8] (German: Internationale Automobil-\nAusstellung).[9] The car was developed with the proof-of-concept\ntwin-fan Type 745 flat-six engine, but the car presented at the auto\nshow had a non-operational mockup of the single-fan 901 engine,\nreceiving a working uni t in February 1964.[7]\nIt originally was designated as the \"Porsche 901\"  (901 being its\ninternal project number). A total of 82 cars were built as which were badged as 901s.[7] However, French\nautomobile manufacturer Peugeot protested on the grounds  that in France it had exclusive rights to car\nnames formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. Instead of selling the new model with a different\nname in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. Internally, the cars' part numbers carried on the prefix\n901 for years.[7] Produc tion began in September 1964,[9] with the first 911s exported to the US in February\n1965.[7]\nThe first models of the 911 had a rear-mounted 130 hp ( 97 kW )[1] Type 901/ 01 flat-6 engine, in the \"boxe r\"\nconfiguration like the 356, the engine is air-cooled and displaces 1,991 cc (2.0 L) as compared to the 356's\nfour-cylinder, 1,582 cc (1.6 L) unit. The car had four seats although the rear seats were small, thus it is\nusually called a 2+2 rather than a four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). A four or five-speed \"Type 901\"\nmanual transmission was available. The styling was largely penned by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of\nFerdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche. Butzi Porsche initially came up with a notchback design with proper space for\nseating two rear passengers but Ferry Porsche insisted that the 356's successor was to use its fastback\nstyling. 7 prototypes were built based on Butzi Porsche's original design and were internally called the\nPorsche 754 T7.[10] Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who\ninitially obj ected, was also involved later in the design.Air-cooled engines (1964\u20131998)\n911, 911E, 911L, 911S, 911T", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3254, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "967fc553-9220-4e52-a77f-a2a57235014e": {"__data__": {"id_": "967fc553-9220-4e52-a77f-a2a57235014e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3db7d0b7-37b1-49a8-8b53-9acb564e6eda", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "aca4f1125d6060eb8dd222e0be75ee79f52b061e61433208d0f300e8fedbf52a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49dc28b5-347a-424c-aeb1-f61b77dea701", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "f4342632c355a905054c3e5ba9715cfbf4727f970c0fbb8f32519aae05ec748e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "736fe37d-76c0-4597-9354-aa6ac2617572", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0af0d91159af16ec790327d709f5d54e6f2ed1f1628b1c15a35a83553d1ed35a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The 911-based 912, powered by a\nflat-4 engine (1967)\nPorsche 911 2.0 Coupe (1964) at the\nPorsche Museum in Stuttgart\nThe 911 R (1967)Produc tion of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market\nfor a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the US. The 912, introduc ed in\nthe same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned\nversion of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, 1,582 cc (1.6 L), 90 hp (67 kW;\n91 PS) boxe r four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodyw ork\nwith Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual\ntransmission w as optional).\nIn 1966, Porsche introduc ed the more powerful 911S with Type\n901/02 engine having a power output of 160 PS (120 kW; 160 hp).\nForged aluminum alloy wheels from Fuchsfelge, with a 5-spoke\ndesign, were offered for the first time. In motorsport at the same\ntime, the engine was developed into the Type 901/20 and was\ninstalled in the mid-engine 904 and 906 with an increased power output of 210 PS (150 kW; 210 hp), as\nwell as fuel injected Type 901/21 installed in later variants of the 906 and 910 with a power output of\n220 P S (160 kW ; 220 hp) .\nIn Augus t 1967, the A series went into produc tion with dual brake circuits and widened (5.5J-15) wheels\nstill fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 165H R15 CA67 tyres.,[11] and the previously standard gasoline-burning\nheater became optional. The Targa (meaning \"plate\" in Italian[12]) version was introduced. The Targa had a\nstainless steel-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open\nconve rtibles to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \"Targa\"\ncame from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, Italy in which Porsche had several victories until\n1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against\nprototypes entered by Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The road-going Targa was equipped with a removable roof\npanel and a removable plastic rear window  (although a  fixed glass version w as offered from 1968) .\nThe 110 PS (81 kW; 110 hp) 911T was also launched in 1967 with\nType 901/03 engine. The 130 PS (96 kW; 130 hp) model was\nrenamed the 911L with Type 901/06 engine and ventilated front\ndisc brakes. The brakes had been introduc ed on the previous 911S.\nThe 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited produc tion (20 in all),\nas this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass\nreinforced plastic doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin overhead\ncamshafts, and a pow er output of 210 P S (150 kW ; 210 hp) .\nA clutchless semi-automatic Spor tomatic[13][14] model, composed\nof a torque converter, an automatic clutch, and the four-speed\ntransmission was added in Autumn 1967 .

It remained in\nproduc tion until July 1969. The 911E gained 185/70VR15 Pirelli\nCinturato CN36,[16] and 6J -15 w heels.\nThe C series was introduc ed in Augus t 1969 with an enlarged 2.2-\nlitre engine (84 mm bore x 66 mm stroke).

The overall length of the car did not\nchange, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine)\nand for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine).\nThe D series was produc ed from Aug. 1970 to July 1971. The 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower\npower output of the 911/01 engine (155 PS (114 kW; 153 hp) at 6,200 rpm) compared to the 911S's Type\n911/02 (180 PS (130 kW; 180 hp) at 6,500 rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to 160 kilometres\nper hour  (99 m ph).\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (Augus t 1971 to July 1972 produc tion) consisted of the same\nmodels, but with a new, larger 2,341 cc (2.3 L) engine. This is know n as the \"2.4 L\" engine, despite its\ndisplacement being closer to 2.3 litres. The 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch\nmechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was carbureted, except in\nthe US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type\n911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130 hp) to 140 hp commonly know n as a\n911T/E.\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronge r transmission, identified by its\nPorsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901\ntransmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to\nthe left, second gear unde rneath first, etc. The E series had the unus ual oil filler behind the right side door,\nwith the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move\nthe center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on\nthe rear wing, for this reason it became know n as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door )\".\nThe F series (Augus t 1972 to July 1973  produc tion) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-\nwheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline\ninto the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous  Fuel\nInjection) system from Bosch on T ype 911/91 engine.\n911S models also gained a small spoiler unde r the front bumper to improve high-speed stability.

Its price was\nalmost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The\nchassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the\nbraking system was from the 917 racing car. The use of thinner\nmetal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be\nreduced to around 900 kg ( 2,000 l b).\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in\nseveral major sports car races of the mid-1970s . Also, a prototype\nCarrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency\nformula) came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974  and won\nseveral major races, a significant event in that its engine would form\nthe basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's\ncommitment to turbocharger applications in its cars.\nThere is a common misconception that all 911s built between 1974 and 1989 are 'G-series' cars.

Factory figures were more modest: 0\u201397 km/h (60 mph) time of 6.3 seconds for the\nUS version and 6.1 s econds  for cars outside the American market.\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain\ntensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in\nthe front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically\ncontrolled fan.\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control\ncompone nts to an L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An\nimprovement in fuel efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in\nthe fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to 217 hp (162 kW;\n220 PS) (at 5,900 rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low\nemissions, like Germany.\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable\nfrom the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance.\nOnly cosmetic changes were made during the produc tion of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboa rd\nfeaturing larger air conditioning ve nts appearing in 1986.\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduc ed the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was\ncommonly know n as the \"Turbo-Look\" . It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel\narches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the Turbo and the\nsuperior Turbo br aking system as well as the wider Turbo w heels.

With technologies from the 959 flagship model,\nthis would be an important car for Porsche, since the world\neconom y was unde rgoing recession and the company could not rely\non its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\"\nindicating four-wheel-drive, demonstrating the company's\ncommitment to engineering. Drag coefficient was down to 0.32.

The interior was more basic than a\nstandard 911 as well; for example, the interior door panels lacked\nthe armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the\nopening m echanism.\nIn 1990 Porsche introduc ed a Turbocharged version of the 964\nseries. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type\nnumber actually referred to a stillborn project that would have been\na hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991\nthrough 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with\nthe 930's proven 3.3 L engine, improved to have a power output of\n320 PS (240 kW; 320 hp). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6 L\nengine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering 360 PS\n(265 kW; 355 hp) to the rear wheels.

This car was significant as it was the final\nincarnation of the air-cooled 911 first introduc ed in 1964. Most\nenthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-\ncooled 911 series. As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the\nGoldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many\nPorschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal\nblend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"[24]\nPorsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just\nfrom a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"[25] \"993s especially\n[are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"[26]\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodyw ork was smoother, having a noticeably\nmore aerodyna mic front end somewhat reminiscent of the 959. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter\nunde r the supervision of  design chief Harm Lagaay and w as completed in 1991.\nAlong with the revised bodyw ork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension\nthat improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn\nPorsche 989's rear multilink design and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to\noversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner.

The expensive air-\ncooled 993 Targa had a limited produc tion run between 1996 and\n1998. [Production numbers:[27] 1996: US/Can: 462 ROW: 1980,\n1997:  US/Can: 567 ROW: 1276, 1998:  US/Can: 122 (100\nTiptronic / 22 M anual)]\nAs an investment, the 1997 and 1998 Carrera S version has proven\nthe most desirable (apart from even rarer models such as the RS and\nTurbo S). \"Many find that they are the best looking 911 there is and\nused prices have always seemed to reflect this. They command a\nhefty premium in today's market and the very best example wide\nbody cars can be priced more than the higher mileage Turbos.\"[28]\nOf the widebody 993 series, \"The purists will want 2 wheel drive\nand nothing else will do.\"[29] Similarly, purists will insist upon the manual transmission over the automatic\n\"Tiptronic\" version; this is even more true in the case of the 993 as compared with other models, because\nPorsche 993s  were the first produc tion model (apart from the 959 flagship sports car) to feature a 6-speed\nmanual transmission.[30] The C2S wide-body 993 models are in scarce supply, with none  built in 1995 or\n1996, and just 759 units made for North America in 1997, with a final supply of 993 in 1998, for a total of\n1,752 C 2S examples overall.[31]\nA Turbocharged version of the 993 was launched in 1995 and\nbecame the first standard produc tion Porsche with twin\nturbochargers and the first 911 Turbo to be equipped with\npermanent all-wheel-drive (the homologated GT2 version based on\nthe Turbo retained RWD). The similarity in specification and in\nperformance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the\n959.[32] The 3.6 L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at\n408 PS (300 kW; 402 hp)). The performance was outstanding at the\ntime, as 0 to 97 km/h (60 mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds ,\nand the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the993 Turbo (1995\u20131997)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3386, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1377dedc-9255-4d87-825d-fc99a0da43ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "1377dedc-9255-4d87-825d-fc99a0da43ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a9fc0cc-d1c5-44aa-945f-05417e29f0f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "a74cf321fddf44b72ccccc631ee8665ce60c233c124921ac6dfbc5f49cad67cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b6ffe5a-a5c0-44e2-b754-023767f1ea7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "ff7bddc2936dd0c5005f217a2801f4dbb8d5a995e7b6060235f2bb8433628513", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a011ca03-9b7d-4464-9986-144cfbe5735b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e85f903b97acf743fd671d5cca62a9436532bf60d39b085a0c764314558eba76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2002 996 Carrera 4Ssame speed. The car's top speed was measured at 322 km/h (200 mph) at 7,000 rpm. The differences were\nstriking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer-controlled all wheel\ndrive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling\nfor the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produc ed in 1996 and 1997 model\nyears. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade,\nwhile the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the\n1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above  the interior rear\nview mirror on the 1997 w hile the 1996 ha d no s uch devices.\nIn 1997, Porsche introduc ed a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbe d the\nturbo S. With 24 PS (18 kW; 24 hp) over the regular Turbo's 408 PS (300 kW; 402 hp), features include a\nscoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside\nfrom an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was\nadded.\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes\nfor the venerable 911 lineage: a water-cooled flat-6 engine replaced\nthe popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34 years and the\nbody shell received its first major re-design. Changing to a water-\ncooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who\nnoted this as the end of  the 'true' 911.\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine\nentry-level Boxster. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won\ninternational design awards between 1997 a nd 2003.[33]\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 coefficient of drag. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of\nrelationship to prior 911 interiors, although t his came largely from owners of older 911s.[34]\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the\nlatter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented GT3 and GT3 RS instead\nof a Carrera RS variant and the forced-induc tion 996 Turbo and GT2. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-\ndrive and had a twin-turbocharged engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on\nsale.\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 unde rwent revisions for the 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear\nindicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be\nmore distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduc ed, though the basic\narchitecture remained.\nEngine displacement was 3.4 L and power output was 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) featuring a change to an\n\"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6 L\nand pow er received an increase to 320 P S (235 kW ; 316 hp) .\nThe folding roof mechanism on the conve rtible variants required 19 s econds for operation. An electronically\nadjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120 km/h (75 mph).

The exception would be\nfor MY1999 w here the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.\nPorsche introduc ed a road-\nlegal GT3 version of the\n996 series which was\nderived from the company's\nracing car used in the GT3\nclass racing. Simply called\nGT3, the car featured\nlightweight materials\nincluding thinner window s\nand deletion of the rear\nseats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with an\nemphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension\nride height was lowered and tuned for respons iveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions\nimproved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a\nversion of the water-cooled units found  in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived\nfrom the 911 GT1 '98 sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the\nengine to have higher rpm.\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated 3,600 cc (3.6 L) flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-\nfacelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at 365 PS (268 kW; 360 hp) at first and later improved to 386 PS\n(284 kW ; 381 hp)  at the end of  the 996 s eries' revision.\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type\n996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was\nderived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its\npredecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of\n420 PS (309 kW; 414 hp).[35] Also like its predecessor, the new\nTurbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50\npackage was available that increased the engine output to 450 PS\n(331 kW; 444 hp) with 620 N \u22c5 m (457 lb \u22c5 ft) of torque across a wide\nsection of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could\naccelerate from 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) in 3.91 seconds.

It has VTG (variable turbine geometry), that\ncombines the low-rev boos t and quick respons es of a small\nturbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It\nalso offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo. The\n997 Turbo features a new all-wheel-drive system, similar to the one\nfound on the Cayenne. The new PTM (Porsche Traction\nManagement) system incorporates a clutch-based system that varies the amount of torque to the wheels to\navoid tyre slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or unde rsteer results in\nneutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, know n internally as the 997.2 (as oppos ed to the 997.1\n2007- 2009 model years), launched in Augus t 2009,[39] the PTM system was tweaked to give a more\nrearward power bias.

The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from\nboth the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line\nbeginning in 2015, w ith the \"type 991\"  911 successor.\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of\nonly 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produc ed\nrecalling the iconic car of the 1950s . It was the third 911 Speedster\nproduc ed, the other two being from the 930 and 964 generations.\nThe Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera\nGTS which is rated at 414 PS (304 kW; 408 hp). It accelerated\nfrom 0 to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 4.2 seconds  and attained a top speed\nof around 310 km/h (190 mph). Only two colours were offered,\nPure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and\nCarrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produc ed in very\nlimited num bers and upon s pecial request from \"loyal customers\".)\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the\nsame rake angle.\nThe 991 introduced in 2011 for the 2012 model year is an entirely\nnew platform, only the third since the original 911. Porsche\nrevealed basic information on the new Carrera and Carrera S\nmodels on 23 Augus t 2011.[49] The Carrera is powered by a\n355 PS (261 kW; 350 hp) 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a\n3.8-litre engine rated at 406 PS (299 kW; 400 hp). A Power Kit\n(option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output\nto 436 PS (321 kW; 430 hp). The new 991's overall length grows\nby 56 mm (2.2 in) and wheelbase grows by 99 mm (3.9 in) (now\n96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward\nat roughl y 76 mm (3 in) towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output\nflanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track (51 mm (2 in) wider for the Carrera S).\nThe design team for the 991 w as headed by M ichael Mauer.\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks\nare a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above  the intakes for the twin coolant\nradiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin\ntaillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodyw ork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the\ncenter console, inspired by t he Carrera GT and adopted by t he Panamera.\nThe 991 i s the first 911 to use a predominantly aluminium construction. T his means that even though t he car\nis larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to 50 kilograms (110 lb) lighter. The reduced weight and\nincreased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models.\nThe 0\u201397 km/h (0\u201360 mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the\nCarrera and 4.3 seconds  for the Carrera S.

With the optional sports chrono\npackage, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201397 km/h\n(0\u201360 m ph) in as little as 4.2 s econds[50] and the Carrera S can do t he same in 3.9 s econds.[51]Speedster\n991 Series (2011 \u2013 2019)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3404, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e534e529-a0aa-458f-9ade-d8b208b3a65a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e534e529-a0aa-458f-9ade-d8b208b3a65a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a67863a-d26c-4db1-96fb-253816d752fa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "5d017050af4f367abb4f003d349882656fb02a3792746d408025452f3acbd9f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4df43073-046a-437a-955c-53385c19cc26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "c786c61f7fe1d8a5af5a42851b3b2444bfe10b434fb4c7d0a138626d2bcd1b0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "629c74ef-85c2-42e1-b179-d8d1f0263690", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d0c07060e8d662ac9e501392f4e8f43871ba483dca42f86816b3743744715f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Porsche 991 Turbo S\nThe 991 Targa features an all-new\nelectronically operated roof\nmechanism which allows it to have\nthe original Targa design.Apart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also\nequipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On\nvehicles produc ed in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is\navailable on the 7-speed manual transmission when equipped with\nthe Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the\nmanual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in\nSport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the\ncar is already in 5th or 6th gear.\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to\nimprove fuel econom y as well as increase performance. In order to\nmeet these objectives, Porsche introduc ed a number of new\ntechnologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduc tion of electromechanical\npower steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but\nsome enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new\nsystem. The cars also feature an engine stop/start system that turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a\ncoasting system that allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways.\nThis allows for up to a 16%  reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing m odels.\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque\nvectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of\nthe car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also\nfeature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part\nof the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and\noptional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights while stiffening the suspension during\naggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis\nControl (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap\ntime around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional\nstability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to\nunde rsteer when equipped with this new technology.\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduc ed the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S'\nmodels are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body- work and a red-reflector strip that sits\nin between the tail-lights. The 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive\nsystem that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-\nwheel-drive 911.\nIn May 2013, Porsche announc ed changes to the model year 2014\n911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to 520 PS\n(382 kW; 513 hp) on the 'Turbo', and 560 PS (412 kW; 552 hp) on\nthe 'Turbo S', giving them a 0\u201397 km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and\n2.9 seconds, respectively. A rear-wheel steering system has also\nbeen incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in\nthe oppos ite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high\nspeeds to improve handling.[52] During low-speed maneuvers, this\nhas the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high\nspeeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving\nstability and agility.\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduc ed the new model year 2015\nTarga 4 and Targa 4S models.

Both Carrera and\nCarrera S models break with previous tradition by featuring a 3.0-\nlitre turbocharged 6-cylinder boxe r engine, marking the first time\nthat a forced induc tion engine has been fitted to the base models\nwithin the 911 range.[53]\nPorsche introduc ed the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in\n2013.[54] The 991 GT3 features a new 3.8 litre direct fuel injection\n(DFI) flat-six engine developing 475 PS (349 kW; 469 hp) at 8,250\nrpm, a Porsche Doppe lkuppl ung (PDK) doubl e-clutch gearbox and\nrear-wheel steering. The engine is based on the unit fitted in the 991\nCarrera S, but shares only a few common parts. All other\ncompone nts, particularly the crankshaft and valve train, were\nspecially adapted or developed for the 991 GT3.[55] The dual-\nclutch gearbox is another feature specially developed for the 991\nGT3, based on sequential manual transmissions used in racing\ncars.[56] The 911 GT3 is claimed to be able to accelerate from 0\u2013\n97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.2 seconds  or less, and the quarter mile in\n11.2 s econds  at 203 km /h (126 m ph).[57][58] The GT3 has a claimed top speed of 315 km /h (196 m ph).[59]\nPorsche unveiled the facelifted 991.2 GT3 at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Extensive changes were made\nto the engine allowing a 9,000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on\nreducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and\nlocated further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension.\nThe 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a manual transmission or PDK dual-clutch transmission.\nA touring version was also introduc ed which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual\ntransmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear\nwing instead.\nPorsche launched the Renn Spor t version of the 911 GT3 at the\nGeneva Motor Show in 2015.[60] Compared to the 911 GT3, the\nfront fenders are now equipped with louve rs above  the wheels and\nthe rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an\nintake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The\ninterior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the\n918 Spyde r), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the\nClub Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the\nfront seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point\nsafety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting\nbracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power\noutput of 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp) and 460 N \u22c5 m (339 lb \u22c5 ft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The\ncar accelerates from 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds  (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0)\nand 0\u2013200 km/h (124 mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as\ndeclutching by \" paddle neutral\" \u2014 c omparable to pressing the clutch with a conve ntional manual gearbox \u2013\nand a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring\nPlus with fully variable rear axle differential lock are available as standard.991 GT3\n991 GT3 RS", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3422, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32e8b98e-ab40-4b4b-a350-1918ab6beeed": {"__data__": {"id_": "32e8b98e-ab40-4b4b-a350-1918ab6beeed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77a47bf2-65b7-4bef-a343-11d503d7f81d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "e5a336bac793fabee52f28ec06fa7d7dfdc16e49bcd7e29fc79eff04e8117696", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "629c74ef-85c2-42e1-b179-d8d1f0263690", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "C:/Users/Tyler/OneDrive/Desktop/928_Rag/data/Porsche_911.pdf"}, "hash": "acb7b13347541907a98ab6e2693da1febc715ab7cafbdba60ee9451bfa3c9e8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c07a4d6-328a-4241-b9fa-48857034c870", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3942ddf5952f0ddfb7fd0780443b0f5b7db57a7d7167806a8aa89161580e3faa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Porsche 911 R\nPorsche 991 GT2 RSIn February 2018, Porsche introduc ed a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their upda tes for the 991\ngeneration of the 911.
